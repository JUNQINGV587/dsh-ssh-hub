# dsh-ssh-hub

A DSH Web GUI plugin that lets the user manage named SSH targets and open multiple interactive SSH terminals in a bottom panel.

## Language

**Server**:
A named SSH target the user manages from the panel (host, port, username, auth method). The unit of persistence.
_Avoid_: host, machine, connection

**Auth Kind**:
How the plugin authenticates to a Server: `password`, `privateKey`, `agent`, or `none`.
_Avoid_: auth method, login type

**Secret**:
The credential material of a Server: password, private key (PEM content or file path), key passphrase. Secrets never leave the host process.
_Avoid_: credentials (too broad — usernames are not secrets)

**Server Config**:
The stored record of a Server, including its Secrets.
_Avoid_: server object, entry

**Server View**:
A Server Config with Secrets stripped, replaced by `hasPassword` / `hasPrivateKey` flags. The only representation clients ever receive.
_Avoid_: DTO, public server

**Terminal Session**:
One live SSH connection plus its shell channel, attached to a Server. Ephemeral — never persisted.
_Avoid_: tab (a UI grouping of sessions), connection
